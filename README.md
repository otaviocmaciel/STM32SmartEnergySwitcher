# STM32 Smart Energy Switcher
## Description
This project is being developed for the course "Topics in Electronic Engineering 4" as part of the curriculum for the Electronic Engineering program at the Federal Rural University of Pernambuco (UFRPE), Academic Unit of Cabo de Santo Agostinho (UACSA).

The project consists of analyzing different energy sources to protect the connected load and aims to reduce the cost of energy utilization. The project should be capable of analyzing three different energy sources and define which will be used:

* AC energy source (220V) from the utility company.
* Energy stored in stationary batteries.
* Energy from solar panels.

For this project, an STM32F302 microcontroller was used, a mixed-signal MCU with an Arm® Cortex®-M4 core (with FPU and DSP instructions) running at 72 MHz. The choice of this MCU was based on the peripherals it offers, especially the analog peripherals.
